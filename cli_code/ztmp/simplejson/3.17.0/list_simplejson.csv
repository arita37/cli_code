 |      Create and return a new object.  See help(type) for accurate signature.
 |  
 |  __next__(self, /)
 |      Implement next(self).
 |  
 |  __setstate__(...)
 |

 |      __sizeof__() -> int
 |      size of object in memory, in bytes
 |  
 |  close(self, /)
 |      Disable all I/O operations.
 |  
 |  flush(self, /)
 |      Does nothing.

 |      Retrieve the entire contents of the BytesIO object.
 |  
 |  isatty(self, /)
 |      Always returns False.
 |      
 |      BytesIO objects are not connected to a TTY-like device.
 |  
 |  read(self, size=None, /)
 |      Read at most size bytes, returned as a bytes object.
 |      
 |      If the size argument is negative, read until EOF is reached.
 |      Return an empty bytes object at EOF.
 |  
 |  read1(self, size, /)

 |  readable(self, /)
 |      Returns True if the IO object can be read.
 |  
 |  readinto(self, buffer, /)
 |      Read bytes into buffer.
 |      
 |      Returns number of bytes read (0 for EOF), or None if the object

 |  
 |  readlines(self, size=None, /)
 |      List of bytes objects, each a line from the file.
 |

 |      Returns True if the IO object can be written.
 |  
 |  write(self, b, /)
 |      Write bytes to file.
 |

 |  
 |  writelines(self, lines, /)
 |      Write lines to the file.
 |      
 |      Note that newlines are not added.  lines can be any iterable object
 |      producing bytes-like objects. This is equivalent to calling write() for
 |      each element.

 |      removed from the result.
 |  
 |  splitlines(...)
 |      S.splitlines([keepends]) -> list of strings
 |      
 |      Return a list of the lines in S, breaking at line boundaries.
 |      Line breaks are not included in the resulting list unless keepends
 |      is given and true.
 |  
 |  startswith(...)
 |      S.startswith(prefix[, start[, end]]) -> bool
 |      
 |      Return True if S starts with the specified prefix, False otherwise.
 |      With optional start, test S beginning at that position.
 |      With optional end, stop comparing S at that position.
 |      prefix can also be a tuple of strings to try.
 |  
 |  strip(...)
 |      S.strip([chars]) -> str
 |      
 |      Return a copy of the string S with leading and trailing
 |      whitespace removed.
 |      If chars is given and not None, remove characters in chars instead.
 |  
 |  swapcase(...)
 |      S.swapcase() -> str
 |      
 |      Return a copy of S with uppercase characters converted to lowercase
 |      and vice versa.
 |  
 |  title(...)
 |      S.title() -> str
 |      
 |      Return a titlecased version of S, i.e. words start with title case
 |      characters, all remaining cased characters have lower case.
 |  
 |  translate(...)
 |      S.translate(table) -> str
 |      
 |      Return a copy of the string S in which each character has been mapped
 |      through the given translation table. The table must implement
 |      lookup/indexing via __getitem__, for instance a dictionary or list,
 |      mapping Unicode ordinals to Unicode ordinals, strings, or None. If
 |      this operation raises LookupError, the character is left untouched.
 |      Characters mapped to None are deleted.
 |  
 |  upper(...)
 |      S.upper() -> str
 |      
 |      Return a copy of S converted to uppercase.
 |  
 |  zfill(...)
 |      S.zfill(width) -> str
 |      
 |      Pad a numeric string S with zeros on the left, to fill a field
 |      of the specified width. The string S is never truncated.
 |  
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Static methods defined here:
 |  
 |  maketrans(x, y=None, z=None, /)
 |      Return a translation table usable for str.translate().
 |      
 |      If there is only one argument, it must be a dictionary mapping Unicode
 |      ordinals (integers) or characters to Unicode ordinals, strings or None.
 |      Character keys will be then converted to ordinals.
 |      If there are two arguments, they must be strings of equal length, and
 |      in the resulting dictionary, each character in x will be mapped to the
 |      character at the same position in y. If there is a third argument, it
 |      must be a string, whose characters will be mapped to None in the result.

 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, encoding=None, object_hook=None, parse_float=None, parse_int=None, parse_constant=None, strict=True, object_pairs_hook=None)
 |      *encoding* determines the encoding used to interpret any
 |      :class:`str` objects decoded by this instance (``'utf-8'`` by
 |      default).  It has no effect when decoding :class:`unicode` objects.
 |      
 |      Note that currently only encodings that are a superset of ASCII work,
 |      strings of other encodings should be passed in as :class:`unicode`.
 |      
 |      *object_hook*, if specified, will be called with the result of every
 |      JSON object decoded and its return value will be used in place of the
 |      given :class:`dict`.  This can be used to provide custom
 |      deserializations (e.g. to support JSON-RPC class hinting).
 |      
 |      *object_pairs_hook* is an optional function that will be called with
 |      the result of any object literal decode with an ordered list of pairs.
 |      The return value of *object_pairs_hook* will be used instead of the
 |      :class:`dict`.  This feature can be used to implement custom decoders
 |      that rely on the order that the key and value pairs are decoded (for
 |      example, :func:`collections.OrderedDict` will remember the order of
 |      insertion). If *object_hook* is also defined, the *object_pairs_hook*
 |      takes priority.
 |      
 |      *parse_float*, if specified, will be called with the string of every
 |      JSON float to be decoded.  By default, this is equivalent to
 |      ``float(num_str)``. This can be used to use another datatype or parser
 |      for JSON floats (e.g. :class:`decimal.Decimal`).
 |      
 |      *parse_int*, if specified, will be called with the string of every
 |      JSON int to be decoded.  By default, this is equivalent to
 |      ``int(num_str)``.  This can be used to use another datatype or parser
 |      for JSON integers (e.g. :class:`float`).
 |      
 |      *parse_constant*, if specified, will be called with one of the
 |      following strings: ``'-Infinity'``, ``'Infinity'``, ``'NaN'``.  This
 |      can be used to raise an exception if invalid JSON numbers are
 |      encountered.
 |      
 |      *strict* controls the parser's behavior when it encounters an
 |      invalid control character in a string. The default setting of
 |      ``True`` means that unescaped control characters are parse errors, if
 |      ``False`` then control characters will be allowed in strings.
 |  
 |  decode(self, s, _w=<built-in method match of _sre.SRE_Pattern object at 0x0000000004DE73F0>, _PY3=True)
 |      Return the Python representation of ``s`` (a ``str`` or ``unicode``
 |      instance containing a JSON document)
 |  
 |  raw_decode(self, s, idx=0, _w=<built-in method match of _sre.SRE_Pattern object at 0x0000000004DE73F0>, _PY3=True)
 |      Decode a JSON document from ``s`` (a ``str`` or ``unicode``
 |      beginning with a JSON document) and return a 2-tuple of the Python
 |      representation and the index in ``s`` where the document ended.
 |      Optionally, ``idx`` can be used to specify an offset in ``s`` where
 |      the JSON document begins.
 |      
 |      This can be used to decode a JSON document from a string that may
 |      have extraneous data at the end.

 |  It also understands ``NaN``, ``Infinity``, and ``-Infinity`` as
 |  their corresponding ``float`` values, which is outside the JSON spec.
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, encoding=None, object_hook=None, parse_float=None, parse_int=None, parse_constant=None, strict=True, object_pairs_hook=None)
 |      *encoding* determines the encoding used to interpret any
 |      :class:`str` objects decoded by this instance (``'utf-8'`` by
 |      default).  It has no effect when decoding :class:`unicode` objects.
 |      
 |      Note that currently only encodings that are a superset of ASCII work,
 |      strings of other encodings should be passed in as :class:`unicode`.
 |      
 |      *object_hook*, if specified, will be called with the result of every
 |      JSON object decoded and its return value will be used in place of the
 |      given :class:`dict`.  This can be used to provide custom
 |      deserializations (e.g. to support JSON-RPC class hinting).
 |      
 |      *object_pairs_hook* is an optional function that will be called with
 |      the result of any object literal decode with an ordered list of pairs.
 |      The return value of *object_pairs_hook* will be used instead of the
 |      :class:`dict`.  This feature can be used to implement custom decoders
 |      that rely on the order that the key and value pairs are decoded (for
 |      example, :func:`collections.OrderedDict` will remember the order of
 |      insertion). If *object_hook* is also defined, the *object_pairs_hook*
 |      takes priority.
 |      
 |      *parse_float*, if specified, will be called with the string of every
 |      JSON float to be decoded.  By default, this is equivalent to
 |      ``float(num_str)``. This can be used to use another datatype or parser
 |      for JSON floats (e.g. :class:`decimal.Decimal`).
 |      
 |      *parse_int*, if specified, will be called with the string of every
 |      JSON int to be decoded.  By default, this is equivalent to
 |      ``int(num_str)``.  This can be used to use another datatype or parser
 |      for JSON integers (e.g. :class:`float`).
 |      
 |      *parse_constant*, if specified, will be called with one of the
 |      following strings: ``'-Infinity'``, ``'Infinity'``, ``'NaN'``.  This
 |      can be used to raise an exception if invalid JSON numbers are
 |      encountered.
 |      
 |      *strict* controls the parser's behavior when it encounters an
 |      invalid control character in a string. The default setting of
 |      ``True`` means that unescaped control characters are parse errors, if
 |      ``False`` then control characters will be allowed in strings.
 |  
 |  decode(self, s, _w=<built-in method match of _sre.SRE_Pattern object at 0x0000000004DE73F0>, _PY3=True)
 |      Return the Python representation of ``s`` (a ``str`` or ``unicode``
 |      instance containing a JSON document)
 |  
 |  raw_decode(self, s, idx=0, _w=<built-in method match of _sre.SRE_Pattern object at 0x0000000004DE73F0>, _PY3=True)
 |      Decode a JSON document from ``s`` (a ``str`` or ``unicode``
 |      beginning with a JSON document) and return a 2-tuple of the Python
 |      representation and the index in ``s`` where the document ended.
 |      Optionally, ``idx`` can be used to specify an offset in ``s`` where
 |      the JSON document begins.
 |      
 |      This can be used to decode a JSON document from a string that may
 |      have extraneous data at the end.

class JSONEncoder(builtins.object)
 |  Extensible JSON <http://json.org> encoder for Python data structures.
 |  
 |  Supports the following objects and types by default:
 |  
 |  +-------------------+---------------+
 |  | Python            | JSON          |
 |  +===================+===============+
 |  | dict, namedtuple  | object        |

 |  
 |  To extend this to recognize other objects, subclass and implement a
 |  ``.default()`` method with another method that returns a serializable
 |  object for ``o`` if possible, otherwise it should call the superclass
 |  implementation (to raise ``TypeError``).
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, skipkeys=False, ensure_ascii=True, check_circular=True, allow_nan=True, sort_keys=False, indent=None, separators=None, encoding='utf-8', default=None, use_decimal=True, namedtuple_as_object=True, tuple_as_array=True, bigint_as_string=False, item_sort_key=None, for_json=False, ignore_nan=False, int_as_string_bitcount=None, iterable_as_array=False)
 |      Constructor for JSONEncoder, with sensible defaults.
 |      
 |      If skipkeys is false, then it is a TypeError to attempt
 |      encoding of keys that are not str, int, long, float or None.  If
 |      skipkeys is True, such items are simply skipped.
 |      
 |      If ensure_ascii is true, the output is guaranteed to be str
 |      objects with all incoming unicode characters escaped.  If
 |      ensure_ascii is false, the output will be unicode object.
 |      
 |      If check_circular is true, then lists, dicts, and custom encoded
 |      objects will be checked for circular references during encoding to
 |      prevent an infinite recursion (which would cause an OverflowError).
 |      Otherwise, no such check takes place.
 |      
 |      If allow_nan is true, then NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity will be
 |      encoded as such.  This behavior is not JSON specification compliant,
 |      but is consistent with most JavaScript based encoders and decoders.
 |      Otherwise, it will be a ValueError to encode such floats.
 |      
 |      If sort_keys is true, then the output of dictionaries will be
 |      sorted by key; this is useful for regression tests to ensure
 |      that JSON serializations can be compared on a day-to-day basis.
 |      
 |      If indent is a string, then JSON array elements and object members
 |      will be pretty-printed with a newline followed by that string repeated
 |      for each level of nesting. ``None`` (the default) selects the most compact
 |      representation without any newlines. For backwards compatibility with
 |      versions of simplejson earlier than 2.1.0, an integer is also accepted
 |      and is converted to a string with that many spaces.
 |      
 |      If specified, separators should be an (item_separator, key_separator)
 |      tuple.  The default is (', ', ': ') if *indent* is ``None`` and
 |      (',', ': ') otherwise.  To get the most compact JSON representation,
 |      you should specify (',', ':') to eliminate whitespace.
 |      
 |      If specified, default is a function that gets called for objects
 |      that can't otherwise be serialized.  It should return a JSON encodable
 |      version of the object or raise a ``TypeError``.
 |      
 |      If encoding is not None, then all input strings will be
 |      transformed into unicode using that encoding prior to JSON-encoding.
 |      The default is UTF-8.
 |      
 |      If use_decimal is true (default: ``True``), ``decimal.Decimal`` will
 |      be supported directly by the encoder. For the inverse, decode JSON
 |      with ``parse_float=decimal.Decimal``.
 |      
 |      If namedtuple_as_object is true (the default), objects with
 |      ``_asdict()`` methods will be encoded as JSON objects.
 |      
 |      If tuple_as_array is true (the default), tuple (and subclasses) will
 |      be encoded as JSON arrays.
 |      
 |      If *iterable_as_array* is true (default: ``False``),
 |      any object not in the above table that implements ``__iter__()``
 |      will be encoded as a JSON array.
 |      
 |      If bigint_as_string is true (not the default), ints 2**53 and higher
 |      or lower than -2**53 will be encoded as strings. This is to avoid the
 |      rounding that happens in Javascript otherwise.
 |      
 |      If int_as_string_bitcount is a positive number (n), then int of size
 |      greater than or equal to 2**n or lower than or equal to -2**n will be
 |      encoded as strings.
 |      
 |      If specified, item_sort_key is a callable used to sort the items in
 |      each dictionary. This is useful if you want to sort items other than
 |      in alphabetical order by key.
 |      
 |      If for_json is true (not the default), objects with a ``for_json()``
 |      method will use the return value of that method for encoding as JSON
 |      instead of the object.
 |      
 |      If *ignore_nan* is true (default: ``False``), then out of range
 |      :class:`float` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``) will be serialized
 |      as ``null`` in compliance with the ECMA-262 specification. If true,
 |      this will override *allow_nan*.
 |  
 |  default(self, o)
 |      Implement this method in a subclass such that it returns
 |      a serializable object for ``o``, or calls the base implementation
 |      (to raise a ``TypeError``).
 |      
 |      For example, to support arbitrary iterators, you could
 |      implement default like this::
 |      
 |          def default(self, o):
 |              try:
 |                  iterable = iter(o)
 |              except TypeError:
 |                  pass
 |              else:
 |                  return list(iterable)
 |              return JSONEncoder.default(self, o)
 |  
 |  encode(self, o)
 |      Return a JSON string representation of a Python data structure.
 |      
 |      >>> from simplejson import JSONEncoder
 |      >>> JSONEncoder().encode({""foo"": [""bar"", ""baz""]})
 |      '{""foo"": [""bar"", ""baz""]}'
 |  
 |  iterencode(self, o, _one_shot=False)
 |      Encode the given object and yield each string
 |      representation as available.
 |      
 |      For example::
 |      
 |          for chunk in JSONEncoder().iterencode(bigobject):
 |              mysocket.write(chunk)

 |  ``.default()`` method with another method that returns a serializable
 |  object for ``o`` if possible, otherwise it should call the superclass
 |  implementation (to raise ``TypeError``).
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, skipkeys=False, ensure_ascii=True, check_circular=True, allow_nan=True, sort_keys=False, indent=None, separators=None, encoding='utf-8', default=None, use_decimal=True, namedtuple_as_object=True, tuple_as_array=True, bigint_as_string=False, item_sort_key=None, for_json=False, ignore_nan=False, int_as_string_bitcount=None, iterable_as_array=False)
 |      Constructor for JSONEncoder, with sensible defaults.
 |      
 |      If skipkeys is false, then it is a TypeError to attempt
 |      encoding of keys that are not str, int, long, float or None.  If
 |      skipkeys is True, such items are simply skipped.
 |      
 |      If ensure_ascii is true, the output is guaranteed to be str
 |      objects with all incoming unicode characters escaped.  If
 |      ensure_ascii is false, the output will be unicode object.
 |      
 |      If check_circular is true, then lists, dicts, and custom encoded
 |      objects will be checked for circular references during encoding to
 |      prevent an infinite recursion (which would cause an OverflowError).
 |      Otherwise, no such check takes place.
 |      
 |      If allow_nan is true, then NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity will be
 |      encoded as such.  This behavior is not JSON specification compliant,
 |      but is consistent with most JavaScript based encoders and decoders.
 |      Otherwise, it will be a ValueError to encode such floats.
 |      
 |      If sort_keys is true, then the output of dictionaries will be
 |      sorted by key; this is useful for regression tests to ensure
 |      that JSON serializations can be compared on a day-to-day basis.
 |      
 |      If indent is a string, then JSON array elements and object members
 |      will be pretty-printed with a newline followed by that string repeated
 |      for each level of nesting. ``None`` (the default) selects the most compact
 |      representation without any newlines. For backwards compatibility with
 |      versions of simplejson earlier than 2.1.0, an integer is also accepted
 |      and is converted to a string with that many spaces.
 |      
 |      If specified, separators should be an (item_separator, key_separator)
 |      tuple.  The default is (', ', ': ') if *indent* is ``None`` and
 |      (',', ': ') otherwise.  To get the most compact JSON representation,
 |      you should specify (',', ':') to eliminate whitespace.
 |      
 |      If specified, default is a function that gets called for objects
 |      that can't otherwise be serialized.  It should return a JSON encodable
 |      version of the object or raise a ``TypeError``.
 |      
 |      If encoding is not None, then all input strings will be
 |      transformed into unicode using that encoding prior to JSON-encoding.
 |      The default is UTF-8.
 |      
 |      If use_decimal is true (default: ``True``), ``decimal.Decimal`` will
 |      be supported directly by the encoder. For the inverse, decode JSON
 |      with ``parse_float=decimal.Decimal``.
 |      
 |      If namedtuple_as_object is true (the default), objects with
 |      ``_asdict()`` methods will be encoded as JSON objects.
 |      
 |      If tuple_as_array is true (the default), tuple (and subclasses) will
 |      be encoded as JSON arrays.
 |      
 |      If *iterable_as_array* is true (default: ``False``),
 |      any object not in the above table that implements ``__iter__()``
 |      will be encoded as a JSON array.
 |      
 |      If bigint_as_string is true (not the default), ints 2**53 and higher
 |      or lower than -2**53 will be encoded as strings. This is to avoid the
 |      rounding that happens in Javascript otherwise.
 |      
 |      If int_as_string_bitcount is a positive number (n), then int of size
 |      greater than or equal to 2**n or lower than or equal to -2**n will be
 |      encoded as strings.
 |      
 |      If specified, item_sort_key is a callable used to sort the items in
 |      each dictionary. This is useful if you want to sort items other than
 |      in alphabetical order by key.
 |      
 |      If for_json is true (not the default), objects with a ``for_json()``
 |      method will use the return value of that method for encoding as JSON
 |      instead of the object.
 |      
 |      If *ignore_nan* is true (default: ``False``), then out of range
 |      :class:`float` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``) will be serialized
 |      as ``null`` in compliance with the ECMA-262 specification. If true,
 |      this will override *allow_nan*.
 |  
 |  default(self, o)
 |      Implement this method in a subclass such that it returns
 |      a serializable object for ``o``, or calls the base implementation
 |      (to raise a ``TypeError``).
 |      
 |      For example, to support arbitrary iterators, you could
 |      implement default like this::
 |      
 |          def default(self, o):
 |              try:

 |                  return list(iterable)
 |              return JSONEncoder.default(self, o)
 |  
 |  encode(self, o)
 |      Return a JSON string representation of a Python data structure.

 |      
 |      If *iterable_as_array* is true (default: ``False``),

 |      will be encoded as a JSON array.
 |      
 |      If bigint_as_string is true (not the default), ints 2**53 and higher

 |      
 |      If int_as_string_bitcount is a positive number (n), then int of size

 |      If for_json is true (not the default), objects with a ``for_json()``

 |      
 |      If *ignore_nan* is true (default: ``False``), then out of range

 |

 |      Implement this method in a subclass such that it returns
 |      a serializable object for ``o``, or calls the base implementation
 |      (to raise a ``TypeError``).
 |      
 |      For example, to support arbitrary iterators, you could

 |  To extend this to recognize other objects, subclass and implement a
 |  ``.default()`` method with another method that returns a serializable
 |  object for ``o`` if possible, otherwise it should call the superclass
 |  implementation (to raise ``TypeError``).
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, skipkeys=False, ensure_ascii=True, check_circular=True, allow_nan=True, sort_keys=False, indent=None, separators=None, encoding='utf-8', default=None, use_decimal=True, namedtuple_as_object=True, tuple_as_array=True, bigint_as_string=False, item_sort_key=None, for_json=False, ignore_nan=False, int_as_string_bitcount=None, iterable_as_array=False)
 |      Constructor for JSONEncoder, with sensible defaults.
 |      
 |      If skipkeys is false, then it is a TypeError to attempt
 |      encoding of keys that are not str, int, long, float or None.  If
 |      skipkeys is True, such items are simply skipped.
 |      
 |      If ensure_ascii is true, the output is guaranteed to be str
 |      objects with all incoming unicode characters escaped.  If
 |      ensure_ascii is false, the output will be unicode object.
 |      
 |      If check_circular is true, then lists, dicts, and custom encoded
 |      objects will be checked for circular references during encoding to
 |      prevent an infinite recursion (which would cause an OverflowError).
 |      Otherwise, no such check takes place.
 |      
 |      If allow_nan is true, then NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity will be
 |      encoded as such.  This behavior is not JSON specification compliant,
 |      but is consistent with most JavaScript based encoders and decoders.
 |      Otherwise, it will be a ValueError to encode such floats.
 |      
 |      If sort_keys is true, then the output of dictionaries will be
 |      sorted by key; this is useful for regression tests to ensure
 |      that JSON serializations can be compared on a day-to-day basis.
 |      
 |      If indent is a string, then JSON array elements and object members
 |      will be pretty-printed with a newline followed by that string repeated
 |      for each level of nesting. ``None`` (the default) selects the most compact
 |      representation without any newlines. For backwards compatibility with
 |      versions of simplejson earlier than 2.1.0, an integer is also accepted
 |      and is converted to a string with that many spaces.
 |      
 |      If specified, separators should be an (item_separator, key_separator)
 |      tuple.  The default is (', ', ': ') if *indent* is ``None`` and
 |      (',', ': ') otherwise.  To get the most compact JSON representation,
 |      you should specify (',', ':') to eliminate whitespace.
 |      
 |      If specified, default is a function that gets called for objects
 |      that can't otherwise be serialized.  It should return a JSON encodable
 |      version of the object or raise a ``TypeError``.
 |      
 |      If encoding is not None, then all input strings will be
 |      transformed into unicode using that encoding prior to JSON-encoding.
 |      The default is UTF-8.
 |      
 |      If use_decimal is true (default: ``True``), ``decimal.Decimal`` will
 |      be supported directly by the encoder. For the inverse, decode JSON
 |      with ``parse_float=decimal.Decimal``.
 |      
 |      If namedtuple_as_object is true (the default), objects with
 |      ``_asdict()`` methods will be encoded as JSON objects.
 |      
 |      If tuple_as_array is true (the default), tuple (and subclasses) will
 |      be encoded as JSON arrays.

 |      any object not in the above table that implements ``__iter__()``
 |      will be encoded as a JSON array.

 |      If sort_keys is true, then the output of dictionaries will be

 |      that JSON serializations can be compared on a day-to-day basis.
 |      
 |      If indent is a string, then JSON array elements and object members
 |      will be pretty-printed with a newline followed by that string repeated
 |      for each level of nesting. ``None`` (the default) selects the most compact
 |      representation without any newlines. For backwards compatibility with
 |      versions of simplejson earlier than 2.1.0, an integer is also accepted
 |      and is converted to a string with that many spaces.
 |      
 |      If specified, separators should be an (item_separator, key_separator)
 |      tuple.  The default is (', ', ': ') if *indent* is ``None`` and
 |      (',', ': ') otherwise.  To get the most compact JSON representation,
 |      you should specify (',', ':') to eliminate whitespace.
 |      
 |      If specified, default is a function that gets called for objects
 |      that can't otherwise be serialized.  It should return a JSON encodable
 |      version of the object or raise a ``TypeError``.
 |      
 |      If encoding is not None, then all input strings will be
 |      transformed into unicode using that encoding prior to JSON-encoding.
 |      The default is UTF-8.
 |      
 |      If use_decimal is true (default: ``True``), ``decimal.Decimal`` will
 |      be supported directly by the encoder. For the inverse, decode JSON
 |      with ``parse_float=decimal.Decimal``.
 |      
 |      If namedtuple_as_object is true (the default), objects with
 |      ``_asdict()`` methods will be encoded as JSON objects.
 |      
 |      If tuple_as_array is true (the default), tuple (and subclasses) will
 |      be encoded as JSON arrays.
 |      
 |      If *iterable_as_array* is true (default: ``False``),
 |      any object not in the above table that implements ``__iter__()``
 |      will be encoded as a JSON array.
 |      
 |      If bigint_as_string is true (not the default), ints 2**53 and higher
 |      or lower than -2**53 will be encoded as strings. This is to avoid the
 |      rounding that happens in Javascript otherwise.
 |      
 |      If int_as_string_bitcount is a positive number (n), then int of size
 |      greater than or equal to 2**n or lower than or equal to -2**n will be
 |      encoded as strings.
 |      
 |      If specified, item_sort_key is a callable used to sort the items in
 |      each dictionary. This is useful if you want to sort items other than
 |      in alphabetical order by key.
 |      
 |      If for_json is true (not the default), objects with a ``for_json()``
 |      method will use the return value of that method for encoding as JSON
 |      instead of the object.
 |      
 |      If *ignore_nan* is true (default: ``False``), then out of range
 |      :class:`float` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``) will be serialized
 |      as ``null`` in compliance with the ECMA-262 specification. If true,
 |      this will override *allow_nan*.
 |  
 |  default(self, o)
 |      Implement this method in a subclass such that it returns
 |      a serializable object for ``o``, or calls the base implementation
 |      (to raise a ``TypeError``).
 |      
 |      For example, to support arbitrary iterators, you could
 |      implement default like this::
 |      
 |          def default(self, o):
 |              try:
 |                  iterable = iter(o)

 |                  return list(iterable)
 |              return JSONEncoder.default(self, o)
 |  
 |  encode(self, o)
 |      Return a JSON string representation of a Python data structure.

 |      Constructor for JSONEncoder, with sensible defaults.
 |      
 |      If skipkeys is false, then it is a TypeError to attempt

 |      If ensure_ascii is true, the output is guaranteed to be str

 |      
 |      If check_circular is true, then lists, dicts, and custom encoded

 |      prevent an infinite recursion (which would cause an OverflowError).
 |      Otherwise, no such check takes place.
 |      
 |      If allow_nan is true, then NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity will be

 |  To extend this to recognize other objects, subclass and implement a
 |  ``.default()`` method with another method that returns a serializable
 |  object for ``o`` if possible, otherwise it should call the superclass
 |  implementation (to raise ``TypeError``).
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, skipkeys=False, ensure_ascii=True, check_circular=True, allow_nan=True, sort_keys=False, indent=None, separators=None, encoding='utf-8', default=None, use_decimal=True, namedtuple_as_object=True, tuple_as_array=True, bigint_as_string=False, item_sort_key=None, for_json=False, ignore_nan=False, int_as_string_bitcount=None, iterable_as_array=False)
 |      Constructor for JSONEncoder, with sensible defaults.
 |      
 |      If skipkeys is false, then it is a TypeError to attempt
 |      encoding of keys that are not str, int, long, float or None.  If
 |      skipkeys is True, such items are simply skipped.
 |      
 |      If ensure_ascii is true, the output is guaranteed to be str
 |      objects with all incoming unicode characters escaped.  If
 |      ensure_ascii is false, the output will be unicode object.
 |      
 |      If check_circular is true, then lists, dicts, and custom encoded
 |      objects will be checked for circular references during encoding to
 |      prevent an infinite recursion (which would cause an OverflowError).
 |      Otherwise, no such check takes place.
 |      
 |      If allow_nan is true, then NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity will be
 |      encoded as such.  This behavior is not JSON specification compliant,
 |      but is consistent with most JavaScript based encoders and decoders.
 |      Otherwise, it will be a ValueError to encode such floats.
 |      
 |      If sort_keys is true, then the output of dictionaries will be
 |      sorted by key; this is useful for regression tests to ensure
 |      that JSON serializations can be compared on a day-to-day basis.
 |      
 |      If indent is a string, then JSON array elements and object members
 |      will be pretty-printed with a newline followed by that string repeated
 |      for each level of nesting. ``None`` (the default) selects the most compact
 |      representation without any newlines. For backwards compatibility with
 |      versions of simplejson earlier than 2.1.0, an integer is also accepted
 |      and is converted to a string with that many spaces.
 |      
 |      If specified, separators should be an (item_separator, key_separator)
 |      tuple.  The default is (', ', ': ') if *indent* is ``None`` and
 |      (',', ': ') otherwise.  To get the most compact JSON representation,
 |      you should specify (',', ':') to eliminate whitespace.
 |      
 |      If specified, default is a function that gets called for objects
 |      that can't otherwise be serialized.  It should return a JSON encodable
 |      version of the object or raise a ``TypeError``.
 |      
 |      If encoding is not None, then all input strings will be
 |      transformed into unicode using that encoding prior to JSON-encoding.
 |      The default is UTF-8.
 |      
 |      If use_decimal is true (default: ``True``), ``decimal.Decimal`` will
 |      be supported directly by the encoder. For the inverse, decode JSON
 |      with ``parse_float=decimal.Decimal``.
 |      
 |      If namedtuple_as_object is true (the default), objects with
 |      ``_asdict()`` methods will be encoded as JSON objects.
 |      
 |      If tuple_as_array is true (the default), tuple (and subclasses) will
 |      be encoded as JSON arrays.
 |      
 |      If *iterable_as_array* is true (default: ``False``),
 |      any object not in the above table that implements ``__iter__()``
 |      will be encoded as a JSON array.
 |      
 |      If bigint_as_string is true (not the default), ints 2**53 and higher
 |      or lower than -2**53 will be encoded as strings. This is to avoid the
 |      rounding that happens in Javascript otherwise.
 |      
 |      If int_as_string_bitcount is a positive number (n), then int of size
 |      greater than or equal to 2**n or lower than or equal to -2**n will be
 |      encoded as strings.
 |      
 |      If specified, item_sort_key is a callable used to sort the items in
 |      each dictionary. This is useful if you want to sort items other than
 |      in alphabetical order by key.
 |      
 |      If for_json is true (not the default), objects with a ``for_json()``
 |      method will use the return value of that method for encoding as JSON
 |      instead of the object.
 |      
 |      If *ignore_nan* is true (default: ``False``), then out of range
 |      :class:`float` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``) will be serialized
 |      as ``null`` in compliance with the ECMA-262 specification. If true,
 |      this will override *allow_nan*.
 |  
 |  default(self, o)
 |      Implement this method in a subclass such that it returns
 |      a serializable object for ``o``, or calls the base implementation
 |      (to raise a ``TypeError``).
 |      
 |      For example, to support arbitrary iterators, you could
 |      implement default like this::
 |      
 |          def default(self, o):
 |              try:
 |                  iterable = iter(o)
 |              except TypeError:
 |                  pass
 |              else:
 |                  return list(iterable)
 |              return JSONEncoder.default(self, o)
 |  
 |  encode(self, o)
 |      Return a JSON string representation of a Python data structure.
 |      
 |      >>> from simplejson import JSONEncoder
 |      >>> JSONEncoder().encode({""foo"": [""bar"", ""baz""]})
 |      '{""foo"": [""bar"", ""baz""]}'
 |  
 |  iterencode(self, o, _one_shot=False)
 |      Encode the given object and yield each string
 |      representation as available.
 |      
 |      For example::
 |      
 |          for chunk in JSONEncoder().iterencode(bigobject):

 |  To extend this to recognize other objects, subclass and implement a
 |  ``.default()`` method with another method that returns a serializable
 |  object for ``o`` if possible, otherwise it should call the superclass
 |  implementation (to raise ``TypeError``).
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, skipkeys=False, ensure_ascii=True, check_circular=True, allow_nan=True, sort_keys=False, indent=None, separators=None, encoding='utf-8', default=None, use_decimal=True, namedtuple_as_object=True, tuple_as_array=True, bigint_as_string=False, item_sort_key=None, for_json=False, ignore_nan=False, int_as_string_bitcount=None, iterable_as_array=False)
 |      Constructor for JSONEncoder, with sensible defaults.
 |      
 |      If skipkeys is false, then it is a TypeError to attempt
 |      encoding of keys that are not str, int, long, float or None.  If
 |      skipkeys is True, such items are simply skipped.
 |      
 |      If ensure_ascii is true, the output is guaranteed to be str
 |      objects with all incoming unicode characters escaped.  If
 |      ensure_ascii is false, the output will be unicode object.
 |      
 |      If check_circular is true, then lists, dicts, and custom encoded
 |      objects will be checked for circular references during encoding to
 |      prevent an infinite recursion (which would cause an OverflowError).
 |      Otherwise, no such check takes place.
 |      
 |      If allow_nan is true, then NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity will be
 |      encoded as such.  This behavior is not JSON specification compliant,
 |      but is consistent with most JavaScript based encoders and decoders.
 |      Otherwise, it will be a ValueError to encode such floats.
 |      
 |      If sort_keys is true, then the output of dictionaries will be
 |      sorted by key; this is useful for regression tests to ensure
 |      that JSON serializations can be compared on a day-to-day basis.
 |      
 |      If indent is a string, then JSON array elements and object members
 |      will be pretty-printed with a newline followed by that string repeated
 |      for each level of nesting. ``None`` (the default) selects the most compact
 |      representation without any newlines. For backwards compatibility with
 |      versions of simplejson earlier than 2.1.0, an integer is also accepted
 |      and is converted to a string with that many spaces.
 |      
 |      If specified, separators should be an (item_separator, key_separator)
 |      tuple.  The default is (', ', ': ') if *indent* is ``None`` and
 |      (',', ': ') otherwise.  To get the most compact JSON representation,
 |      you should specify (',', ':') to eliminate whitespace.
 |      
 |      If specified, default is a function that gets called for objects
 |      that can't otherwise be serialized.  It should return a JSON encodable
 |      version of the object or raise a ``TypeError``.
 |      
 |      If encoding is not None, then all input strings will be
 |      transformed into unicode using that encoding prior to JSON-encoding.
 |      The default is UTF-8.
 |      
 |      If use_decimal is true (default: ``True``), ``decimal.Decimal`` will
 |      be supported directly by the encoder. For the inverse, decode JSON
 |      with ``parse_float=decimal.Decimal``.
 |      
 |      If namedtuple_as_object is true (the default), objects with
 |      ``_asdict()`` methods will be encoded as JSON objects.
 |      
 |      If tuple_as_array is true (the default), tuple (and subclasses) will
 |      be encoded as JSON arrays.
 |      
 |      If *iterable_as_array* is true (default: ``False``),
 |      any object not in the above table that implements ``__iter__()``
 |      will be encoded as a JSON array.
 |      
 |      If bigint_as_string is true (not the default), ints 2**53 and higher
 |      or lower than -2**53 will be encoded as strings. This is to avoid the
 |      rounding that happens in Javascript otherwise.
 |      
 |      If int_as_string_bitcount is a positive number (n), then int of size
 |      greater than or equal to 2**n or lower than or equal to -2**n will be
 |      encoded as strings.
 |      
 |      If specified, item_sort_key is a callable used to sort the items in
 |      each dictionary. This is useful if you want to sort items other than
 |      in alphabetical order by key.
 |      
 |      If for_json is true (not the default), objects with a ``for_json()``
 |      method will use the return value of that method for encoding as JSON
 |      instead of the object.
 |      
 |      If *ignore_nan* is true (default: ``False``), then out of range
 |      :class:`float` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``) will be serialized
 |      as ``null`` in compliance with the ECMA-262 specification. If true,
 |      this will override *allow_nan*.
 |  
 |  default(self, o)
 |      Implement this method in a subclass such that it returns
 |      a serializable object for ``o``, or calls the base implementation
 |      (to raise a ``TypeError``).
 |      
 |      For example, to support arbitrary iterators, you could
 |      implement default like this::
 |      
 |          def default(self, o):
 |              try:
 |                  iterable = iter(o)
 |              except TypeError:
 |                  pass
 |              else:
 |                  return list(iterable)
 |              return JSONEncoder.default(self, o)
 |  
 |  encode(self, o)
 |      Return a JSON string representation of a Python data structure.
 |      
 |      >>> from simplejson import JSONEncoder
 |      >>> JSONEncoder().encode({""foo"": [""bar"", ""baz""]})
 |      '{""foo"": [""bar"", ""baz""]}'
 |  
 |  iterencode(self, o, _one_shot=False)
 |      Encode the given object and yield each string
 |      representation as available.
 |      
 |      For example::
 |      
 |          for chunk in JSONEncoder().iterencode(bigobject):
 |              mysocket.write(chunk)

 |  To extend this to recognize other objects, subclass and implement a
 |  ``.default()`` method with another method that returns a serializable
 |  object for ``o`` if possible, otherwise it should call the superclass
 |  implementation (to raise ``TypeError``).
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, skipkeys=False, ensure_ascii=True, check_circular=True, allow_nan=True, sort_keys=False, indent=None, separators=None, encoding='utf-8', default=None, use_decimal=True, namedtuple_as_object=True, tuple_as_array=True, bigint_as_string=False, item_sort_key=None, for_json=False, ignore_nan=False, int_as_string_bitcount=None, iterable_as_array=False)
 |      Constructor for JSONEncoder, with sensible defaults.
 |      
 |      If skipkeys is false, then it is a TypeError to attempt
 |      encoding of keys that are not str, int, long, float or None.  If
 |      skipkeys is True, such items are simply skipped.
 |      
 |      If ensure_ascii is true, the output is guaranteed to be str
 |      objects with all incoming unicode characters escaped.  If
 |      ensure_ascii is false, the output will be unicode object.
 |      
 |      If check_circular is true, then lists, dicts, and custom encoded
 |      objects will be checked for circular references during encoding to
 |      prevent an infinite recursion (which would cause an OverflowError).
 |      Otherwise, no such check takes place.
 |      
 |      If allow_nan is true, then NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity will be
 |      encoded as such.  This behavior is not JSON specification compliant,
 |      but is consistent with most JavaScript based encoders and decoders.
 |      Otherwise, it will be a ValueError to encode such floats.
 |      
 |      If sort_keys is true, then the output of dictionaries will be
 |      sorted by key; this is useful for regression tests to ensure
 |      that JSON serializations can be compared on a day-to-day basis.
 |      
 |      If indent is a string, then JSON array elements and object members
 |      will be pretty-printed with a newline followed by that string repeated
 |      for each level of nesting. ``None`` (the default) selects the most compact
 |      representation without any newlines. For backwards compatibility with
 |      versions of simplejson earlier than 2.1.0, an integer is also accepted
 |      and is converted to a string with that many spaces.
 |      
 |      If specified, separators should be an (item_separator, key_separator)
 |      tuple.  The default is (', ', ': ') if *indent* is ``None`` and
 |      (',', ': ') otherwise.  To get the most compact JSON representation,
 |      you should specify (',', ':') to eliminate whitespace.
 |      
 |      If specified, default is a function that gets called for objects
 |      that can't otherwise be serialized.  It should return a JSON encodable
 |      version of the object or raise a ``TypeError``.
 |      
 |      If encoding is not None, then all input strings will be
 |      transformed into unicode using that encoding prior to JSON-encoding.
 |      The default is UTF-8.
 |      
 |      If use_decimal is true (default: ``True``), ``decimal.Decimal`` will
 |      be supported directly by the encoder. For the inverse, decode JSON
 |      with ``parse_float=decimal.Decimal``.
 |      
 |      If namedtuple_as_object is true (the default), objects with
 |      ``_asdict()`` methods will be encoded as JSON objects.
 |      
 |      If tuple_as_array is true (the default), tuple (and subclasses) will
 |      be encoded as JSON arrays.
 |      
 |      If *iterable_as_array* is true (default: ``False``),
 |      any object not in the above table that implements ``__iter__()``
 |      will be encoded as a JSON array.
 |      
 |      If bigint_as_string is true (not the default), ints 2**53 and higher
 |      or lower than -2**53 will be encoded as strings. This is to avoid the
 |      rounding that happens in Javascript otherwise.
 |      
 |      If int_as_string_bitcount is a positive number (n), then int of size
 |      greater than or equal to 2**n or lower than or equal to -2**n will be
 |      encoded as strings.
 |      
 |      If specified, item_sort_key is a callable used to sort the items in
 |      each dictionary. This is useful if you want to sort items other than
 |      in alphabetical order by key.
 |      
 |      If for_json is true (not the default), objects with a ``for_json()``
 |      method will use the return value of that method for encoding as JSON
 |      instead of the object.
 |      
 |      If *ignore_nan* is true (default: ``False``), then out of range
 |      :class:`float` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``) will be serialized
 |      as ``null`` in compliance with the ECMA-262 specification. If true,
 |      this will override *allow_nan*.
 |  
 |  default(self, o)
 |      Implement this method in a subclass such that it returns
 |      a serializable object for ``o``, or calls the base implementation
 |      (to raise a ``TypeError``).

 |              return JSONEncoder.default(self, o)
 |  
 |  encode(self, o)

class JSONEncoderForHTML(JSONEncoder)
 |  An encoder that produces JSON safe to embed in HTML.
 |  
 |  To embed JSON content in, say, a script tag on a web page, the

 |  with the usual entities (e.g. &amp;) because they are not expanded
 |  within <script> tags.
 |  
 |  This class also escapes the line separator and paragraph separator
 |  characters U+2028 and U+2029, irrespective of the ensure_ascii setting,

 |      
 |      For example::

 |      Constructor for JSONEncoder, with sensible defaults.
 |      
 |      If skipkeys is false, then it is a TypeError to attempt
 |      encoding of keys that are not str, int, long, float or None.  If
 |      skipkeys is True, such items are simply skipped.
 |      
 |      If ensure_ascii is true, the output is guaranteed to be str
 |      objects with all incoming unicode characters escaped.  If
 |      ensure_ascii is false, the output will be unicode object.
 |      
 |      If check_circular is true, then lists, dicts, and custom encoded
 |      objects will be checked for circular references during encoding to
 |      prevent an infinite recursion (which would cause an OverflowError).
 |      Otherwise, no such check takes place.
 |      
 |      If allow_nan is true, then NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity will be
 |      encoded as such.  This behavior is not JSON specification compliant,
 |      but is consistent with most JavaScript based encoders and decoders.
 |      Otherwise, it will be a ValueError to encode such floats.
 |      
 |      If sort_keys is true, then the output of dictionaries will be
 |      sorted by key; this is useful for regression tests to ensure
 |      that JSON serializations can be compared on a day-to-day basis.
 |      
 |      If indent is a string, then JSON array elements and object members
 |      will be pretty-printed with a newline followed by that string repeated
 |      for each level of nesting. ``None`` (the default) selects the most compact
 |      representation without any newlines. For backwards compatibility with

 |      tuple.  The default is (', ', ': ') if *indent* is ``None`` and
 |      (',', ': ') otherwise.  To get the most compact JSON representation,
 |      you should specify (',', ':') to eliminate whitespace.
 |      
 |      If specified, default is a function that gets called for objects
 |      that can't otherwise be serialized.  It should return a JSON encodable
 |      version of the object or raise a ``TypeError``.
 |      
 |      If encoding is not None, then all input strings will be

 |      version of the object or raise a ``TypeError``.
 |

 |      will be encoded as a JSON array.
 |      
 |      If bigint_as_string is true (not the default), ints 2**53 and higher
 |      or lower than -2**53 will be encoded as strings. This is to avoid the
 |      rounding that happens in Javascript otherwise.
 |      
 |      If int_as_string_bitcount is a positive number (n), then int of size

 |      
 |      If for_json is true (not the default), objects with a ``for_json()``

 |      instead of the object.
 |      
 |      If *ignore_nan* is true (default: ``False``), then out of range

 |  An encoder that produces JSON safe to embed in HTML.

 |      
 |      If ensure_ascii is true, the output is guaranteed to be str

 |      If indent is a string, then JSON array elements and object members

 |      representation without any newlines. For backwards compatibility with

 |      
 |      If encoding is not None, then all input strings will be

 |      The default is UTF-8.

 |      
 |      If namedtuple_as_object is true (the default), objects with
 |      ``_asdict()`` methods will be encoded as JSON objects.

 |      
 |      If bigint_as_string is true (not the default), ints 2**53 and higher

 |      rounding that happens in Javascript otherwise.
 |      
 |      If int_as_string_bitcount is a positive number (n), then int of size

 |      each dictionary. This is useful if you want to sort items other than
 |      in alphabetical order by key.
 |      
 |      If for_json is true (not the default), objects with a ``for_json()``
 |      method will use the return value of that method for encoding as JSON
 |      instead of the object.
 |      
 |      If *ignore_nan* is true (default: ``False``), then out of range
 |      :class:`float` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``) will be serialized

class JSONEncoderForHTML(JSONEncoder)
 |  An encoder that produces JSON safe to embed in HTML.
 |  
 |  To embed JSON content in, say, a script tag on a web page, the

 |  
 |  This class also escapes the line separator and paragraph separator
 |  characters U+2028 and U+2029, irrespective of the ensure_ascii setting,

 |      Otherwise, it will be a ValueError to encode such floats.
 |      
 |      If sort_keys is true, then the output of dictionaries will be

 |      If indent is a string, then JSON array elements and object members
 |      will be pretty-printed with a newline followed by that string repeated
 |      for each level of nesting. ``None`` (the default) selects the most compact
 |      representation without any newlines. For backwards compatibility with
 |      versions of simplejson earlier than 2.1.0, an integer is also accepted
 |      and is converted to a string with that many spaces.
 |      
 |      If specified, separators should be an (item_separator, key_separator)
 |      tuple.  The default is (', ', ': ') if *indent* is ``None`` and
 |      (',', ': ') otherwise.  To get the most compact JSON representation,
 |      you should specify (',', ':') to eliminate whitespace.
 |      
 |      If specified, default is a function that gets called for objects
 |      that can't otherwise be serialized.  It should return a JSON encodable
 |      version of the object or raise a ``TypeError``.
 |      
 |      If encoding is not None, then all input strings will be
 |      transformed into unicode using that encoding prior to JSON-encoding.
 |      The default is UTF-8.
 |      
 |      If use_decimal is true (default: ``True``), ``decimal.Decimal`` will
 |      be supported directly by the encoder. For the inverse, decode JSON
 |      with ``parse_float=decimal.Decimal``.
 |      
 |      If namedtuple_as_object is true (the default), objects with
 |      ``_asdict()`` methods will be encoded as JSON objects.
 |      
 |      If tuple_as_array is true (the default), tuple (and subclasses) will
 |      be encoded as JSON arrays.
 |      
 |      If *iterable_as_array* is true (default: ``False``),
 |      any object not in the above table that implements ``__iter__()``
 |      will be encoded as a JSON array.
 |      
 |      If bigint_as_string is true (not the default), ints 2**53 and higher
 |      or lower than -2**53 will be encoded as strings. This is to avoid the
 |      rounding that happens in Javascript otherwise.
 |      
 |      If int_as_string_bitcount is a positive number (n), then int of size

 |      encoded as strings.
 |      
 |      If specified, item_sort_key is a callable used to sort the items in
 |      each dictionary. This is useful if you want to sort items other than
 |      in alphabetical order by key.
 |      
 |      If for_json is true (not the default), objects with a ``for_json()``
 |      method will use the return value of that method for encoding as JSON
 |      instead of the object.
 |      
 |      If *ignore_nan* is true (default: ``False``), then out of range
 |      :class:`float` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``) will be serialized
 |      as ``null`` in compliance with the ECMA-262 specification. If true,

 |      objects with all incoming unicode characters escaped.  If
 |      ensure_ascii is false, the output will be unicode object.
 |      
 |      If check_circular is true, then lists, dicts, and custom encoded
 |      objects will be checked for circular references during encoding to
 |      prevent an infinite recursion (which would cause an OverflowError).
 |      Otherwise, no such check takes place.
 |      
 |      If allow_nan is true, then NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity will be
 |      encoded as such.  This behavior is not JSON specification compliant,
 |      but is consistent with most JavaScript based encoders and decoders.
 |      Otherwise, it will be a ValueError to encode such floats.
 |      
 |      If sort_keys is true, then the output of dictionaries will be
 |      sorted by key; this is useful for regression tests to ensure

 |      
 |      If indent is a string, then JSON array elements and object members
 |      will be pretty-printed with a newline followed by that string repeated
 |      for each level of nesting. ``None`` (the default) selects the most compact
 |      representation without any newlines. For backwards compatibility with
 |      versions of simplejson earlier than 2.1.0, an integer is also accepted
 |      and is converted to a string with that many spaces.
 |      
 |      If specified, separators should be an (item_separator, key_separator)
 |      tuple.  The default is (', ', ': ') if *indent* is ``None`` and
 |      (',', ': ') otherwise.  To get the most compact JSON representation,
 |      you should specify (',', ':') to eliminate whitespace.
 |      
 |      If specified, default is a function that gets called for objects
 |      that can't otherwise be serialized.  It should return a JSON encodable
 |      version of the object or raise a ``TypeError``.
 |      
 |      If encoding is not None, then all input strings will be
 |      transformed into unicode using that encoding prior to JSON-encoding.
 |      The default is UTF-8.
 |      
 |      If use_decimal is true (default: ``True``), ``decimal.Decimal`` will
 |      be supported directly by the encoder. For the inverse, decode JSON
 |      with ``parse_float=decimal.Decimal``.
 |      
 |      If namedtuple_as_object is true (the default), objects with
 |      ``_asdict()`` methods will be encoded as JSON objects.
 |      
 |      If tuple_as_array is true (the default), tuple (and subclasses) will
 |      be encoded as JSON arrays.
 |      
 |      If *iterable_as_array* is true (default: ``False``),
 |      any object not in the above table that implements ``__iter__()``
 |      will be encoded as a JSON array.
 |      
 |      If bigint_as_string is true (not the default), ints 2**53 and higher
 |      or lower than -2**53 will be encoded as strings. This is to avoid the
 |      rounding that happens in Javascript otherwise.
 |      
 |      If int_as_string_bitcount is a positive number (n), then int of size

 |      encoded as strings.
 |      
 |      If specified, item_sort_key is a callable used to sort the items in
 |      each dictionary. This is useful if you want to sort items other than
 |      in alphabetical order by key.
 |      
 |      If for_json is true (not the default), objects with a ``for_json()``
 |      method will use the return value of that method for encoding as JSON
 |      instead of the object.
 |      
 |      If *ignore_nan* is true (default: ``False``), then out of range
 |      :class:`float` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``) will be serialized
 |      as ``null`` in compliance with the ECMA-262 specification. If true,
 |      this will override *allow_nan*.
 |  
 |  default(self, o)
 |      Implement this method in a subclass such that it returns
 |      a serializable object for ``o``, or calls the base implementation
 |      (to raise a ``TypeError``).

 |      Constructor for JSONEncoder, with sensible defaults.
 |      
 |      If skipkeys is false, then it is a TypeError to attempt
 |      encoding of keys that are not str, int, long, float or None.  If
 |      skipkeys is True, such items are simply skipped.
 |      
 |      If ensure_ascii is true, the output is guaranteed to be str
 |      objects with all incoming unicode characters escaped.  If
 |      ensure_ascii is false, the output will be unicode object.
 |      
 |      If check_circular is true, then lists, dicts, and custom encoded
 |      objects will be checked for circular references during encoding to
 |      prevent an infinite recursion (which would cause an OverflowError).
 |      Otherwise, no such check takes place.
 |      
 |      If allow_nan is true, then NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity will be
 |      encoded as such.  This behavior is not JSON specification compliant,
 |      but is consistent with most JavaScript based encoders and decoders.
 |      Otherwise, it will be a ValueError to encode such floats.
 |      
 |      If sort_keys is true, then the output of dictionaries will be
 |      sorted by key; this is useful for regression tests to ensure
 |      that JSON serializations can be compared on a day-to-day basis.
 |      
 |      If indent is a string, then JSON array elements and object members
 |      will be pretty-printed with a newline followed by that string repeated
 |      for each level of nesting. ``None`` (the default) selects the most compact
 |      representation without any newlines. For backwards compatibility with
 |      versions of simplejson earlier than 2.1.0, an integer is also accepted
 |      and is converted to a string with that many spaces.
 |      
 |      If specified, separators should be an (item_separator, key_separator)
 |      tuple.  The default is (', ', ': ') if *indent* is ``None`` and
 |      (',', ': ') otherwise.  To get the most compact JSON representation,
 |      you should specify (',', ':') to eliminate whitespace.
 |      
 |      If specified, default is a function that gets called for objects
 |      that can't otherwise be serialized.  It should return a JSON encodable
 |      version of the object or raise a ``TypeError``.
 |      
 |      If encoding is not None, then all input strings will be
 |      transformed into unicode using that encoding prior to JSON-encoding.
 |      The default is UTF-8.
 |      
 |      If use_decimal is true (default: ``True``), ``decimal.Decimal`` will
 |      be supported directly by the encoder. For the inverse, decode JSON
 |      with ``parse_float=decimal.Decimal``.
 |      
 |      If namedtuple_as_object is true (the default), objects with
 |      ``_asdict()`` methods will be encoded as JSON objects.
 |      
 |      If tuple_as_array is true (the default), tuple (and subclasses) will
 |      be encoded as JSON arrays.
 |      
 |      If *iterable_as_array* is true (default: ``False``),
 |      any object not in the above table that implements ``__iter__()``
 |      will be encoded as a JSON array.
 |      
 |      If bigint_as_string is true (not the default), ints 2**53 and higher
 |      or lower than -2**53 will be encoded as strings. This is to avoid the
 |      rounding that happens in Javascript otherwise.
 |      
 |      If int_as_string_bitcount is a positive number (n), then int of size
 |      greater than or equal to 2**n or lower than or equal to -2**n will be
 |      encoded as strings.
 |      
 |      If specified, item_sort_key is a callable used to sort the items in
 |      each dictionary. This is useful if you want to sort items other than
 |      in alphabetical order by key.
 |      
 |      If for_json is true (not the default), objects with a ``for_json()``
 |      method will use the return value of that method for encoding as JSON
 |      instead of the object.
 |      
 |      If *ignore_nan* is true (default: ``False``), then out of range
 |      :class:`float` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``) will be serialized
 |      as ``null`` in compliance with the ECMA-262 specification. If true,
 |      this will override *allow_nan*.
 |  
 |  default(self, o)
 |      Implement this method in a subclass such that it returns
 |      a serializable object for ``o``, or calls the base implementation
 |      (to raise a ``TypeError``).
 |      
 |      For example, to support arbitrary iterators, you could
 |      implement default like this::
 |      
 |          def default(self, o):
 |              try:

 |      Encode the given object and yield each string
 |      representation as available.
 |      
 |      For example::
 |      
 |          for chunk in JSONEncoder().iterencode(bigobject):
 |              mysocket.write(chunk)

 |  Methods inherited from JSONEncoder:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, skipkeys=False, ensure_ascii=True, check_circular=True, allow_nan=True, sort_keys=False, indent=None, separators=None, encoding='utf-8', default=None, use_decimal=True, namedtuple_as_object=True, tuple_as_array=True, bigint_as_string=False, item_sort_key=None, for_json=False, ignore_nan=False, int_as_string_bitcount=None, iterable_as_array=False)
 |      Constructor for JSONEncoder, with sensible defaults.
 |      
 |      If skipkeys is false, then it is a TypeError to attempt
 |      encoding of keys that are not str, int, long, float or None.  If
 |      skipkeys is True, such items are simply skipped.
 |      
 |      If ensure_ascii is true, the output is guaranteed to be str
 |      objects with all incoming unicode characters escaped.  If
 |      ensure_ascii is false, the output will be unicode object.
 |      
 |      If check_circular is true, then lists, dicts, and custom encoded
 |      objects will be checked for circular references during encoding to
 |      prevent an infinite recursion (which would cause an OverflowError).
 |      Otherwise, no such check takes place.
 |      
 |      If allow_nan is true, then NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity will be
 |      encoded as such.  This behavior is not JSON specification compliant,
 |      but is consistent with most JavaScript based encoders and decoders.
 |      Otherwise, it will be a ValueError to encode such floats.
 |      
 |      If sort_keys is true, then the output of dictionaries will be
 |      sorted by key; this is useful for regression tests to ensure
 |      that JSON serializations can be compared on a day-to-day basis.
 |      
 |      If indent is a string, then JSON array elements and object members
 |      will be pretty-printed with a newline followed by that string repeated
 |      for each level of nesting. ``None`` (the default) selects the most compact
 |      representation without any newlines. For backwards compatibility with
 |      versions of simplejson earlier than 2.1.0, an integer is also accepted
 |      and is converted to a string with that many spaces.
 |      
 |      If specified, separators should be an (item_separator, key_separator)
 |      tuple.  The default is (', ', ': ') if *indent* is ``None`` and
 |      (',', ': ') otherwise.  To get the most compact JSON representation,
 |      you should specify (',', ':') to eliminate whitespace.
 |      
 |      If specified, default is a function that gets called for objects
 |      that can't otherwise be serialized.  It should return a JSON encodable
 |      version of the object or raise a ``TypeError``.
 |      
 |      If encoding is not None, then all input strings will be
 |      transformed into unicode using that encoding prior to JSON-encoding.
 |      The default is UTF-8.
 |      
 |      If use_decimal is true (default: ``True``), ``decimal.Decimal`` will
 |      be supported directly by the encoder. For the inverse, decode JSON
 |      with ``parse_float=decimal.Decimal``.
 |      
 |      If namedtuple_as_object is true (the default), objects with
 |      ``_asdict()`` methods will be encoded as JSON objects.
 |      
 |      If tuple_as_array is true (the default), tuple (and subclasses) will
 |      be encoded as JSON arrays.
 |      
 |      If *iterable_as_array* is true (default: ``False``),
 |      any object not in the above table that implements ``__iter__()``
 |      will be encoded as a JSON array.
 |      
 |      If bigint_as_string is true (not the default), ints 2**53 and higher
 |      or lower than -2**53 will be encoded as strings. This is to avoid the
 |      rounding that happens in Javascript otherwise.
 |      
 |      If int_as_string_bitcount is a positive number (n), then int of size
 |      greater than or equal to 2**n or lower than or equal to -2**n will be
 |      encoded as strings.
 |      
 |      If specified, item_sort_key is a callable used to sort the items in
 |      each dictionary. This is useful if you want to sort items other than
 |      in alphabetical order by key.
 |      
 |      If for_json is true (not the default), objects with a ``for_json()``
 |      method will use the return value of that method for encoding as JSON
 |      instead of the object.
 |      
 |      If *ignore_nan* is true (default: ``False``), then out of range
 |      :class:`float` values (``nan``, ``inf``, ``-inf``) will be serialized
 |      as ``null`` in compliance with the ECMA-262 specification. If true,
 |      this will override *allow_nan*.
 |  
 |  default(self, o)
 |      Implement this method in a subclass such that it returns
 |      a serializable object for ``o``, or calls the base implementation
 |      (to raise a ``TypeError``).
 |      
 |      For example, to support arbitrary iterators, you could
 |      implement default like this::
 |      
 |          def default(self, o):
 |              try:
 |                  iterable = iter(o)
 |              except TypeError:
 |                  pass
 |              else:
 |                  return list(iterable)
 |              return JSONEncoder.default(self, o)

 |      
 |      If there is only one argument, it must be a dictionary mapping Unicode
 |      ordinals (integers) or characters to Unicode ordinals, strings or None.
 |      Character keys will be then converted to ordinals.
 |      If there are two arguments, they must be strings of equal length, and
 |      in the resulting dictionary, each character in x will be mapped to the
 |      character at the same position in y. If there is a third argument, it
 |      must be a string, whose characters will be mapped to None in the result.

 |  subclass, specify in the constructor arguments the name of the test method
 |  that the instance is to execute.
 |  
 |  Test authors should subclass TestCase for their own tests. Construction
 |  and deconstruction of the test's environment ('fixture') can be
 |  implemented by overriding the 'setUp' and 'tearDown' methods respectively.
 |  
 |  If it is necessary to override the __init__ method, the base class
 |  __init__ method must always be called. It is important that subclasses
 |  should not change the signature of their __init__ method, since instances
 |  of the classes are instantiated automatically by parts of the framework
 |  in order to be run.
 |  
 |  When subclassing TestCase, you can set these attributes:
 |  * failureException: determines which exception will be raised when
 |      the instance's assertion methods fail; test methods raising this
 |      exception will be deemed to have 'failed' rather than 'errored'.
 |  * longMessage: determines whether long messages (including repr of
 |      objects used in assert methods) will be printed on failure in *addition*
 |      to any explicit message passed.
 |  * maxDiff: sets the maximum length of a diff in failure messages
 |      by assert methods using difflib. It is looked up as an instance
 |      attribute so can be configured by individual tests if required.

 |  Methods inherited from unittest.case.TestCase:
 |  
 |  __call__(self, *args, **kwds)
 |      Call self as a function.
 |  
 |  __eq__(self, other)
 |      Return self==value.
 |  
 |  __hash__(self)
 |      Return hash(self).
 |  
 |  __init__(self, methodName='runTest')
 |      Create an instance of the class that will use the named test
 |      method when executed. Raises a ValueError if the instance does
 |      not have a method with the specified name.
 |  
 |  __repr__(self)
 |      Return repr(self).
 |  
 |  __str__(self)
 |      Return str(self).
 |  
 |  addCleanup(self, function, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Add a function, with arguments, to be called when the test is
 |      completed. Functions added are called on a LIFO basis and are
 |      called after tearDown on test failure or success.
 |      
 |      Cleanup items are called even if setUp fails (unlike tearDown).
 |  
 |  addTypeEqualityFunc(self, typeobj, function)
 |      Add a type specific assertEqual style function to compare a type.
 |      
 |      This method is for use by TestCase subclasses that need to register
 |      their own type equality functions to provide nicer error messages.
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          typeobj: The data type to call this function on when both values
 |                  are of the same type in assertEqual().
 |          function: The callable taking two arguments and an optional
 |                  msg= argument that raises self.failureException with a
 |                  useful error message when the two arguments are not equal.
 |  
 |  assertAlmostEqual(self, first, second, places=None, msg=None, delta=None)
 |      Fail if the two objects are unequal as determined by their
 |      difference rounded to the given number of decimal places
 |      (default 7) and comparing to zero, or by comparing that the
 |      difference between the two objects is more than the given
 |      delta.
 |      
 |      Note that decimal places (from zero) are usually not the same
 |      as significant digits (measured from the most significant digit).
 |      
 |      If the two objects compare equal then they will automatically
 |      compare almost equal.
 |  
 |  assertAlmostEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
 |  
 |  assertCountEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
 |      An unordered sequence comparison asserting that the same elements,
 |      regardless of order.  If the same element occurs more than once,
 |      it verifies that the elements occur the same number of times.
 |      
 |          self.assertEqual(Counter(list(first)),
 |                           Counter(list(second)))
 |      
 |       Example:
 |          - [0, 1, 1] and [1, 0, 1] compare equal.
 |          - [0, 0, 1] and [0, 1] compare unequal.
 |  
 |  assertDictContainsSubset(self, subset, dictionary, msg=None)
 |      Checks whether dictionary is a superset of subset.
 |  
 |  assertDictEqual(self, d1, d2, msg=None)
 |  
 |  assertEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
 |      Fail if the two objects are unequal as determined by the '=='
 |      operator.
 |  
 |  assertEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
 |  
 |  assertFalse(self, expr, msg=None)
 |      Check that the expression is false.
 |  
 |  assertGreater(self, a, b, msg=None)
 |      Just like self.assertTrue(a > b), but with a nicer default message.
 |  
 |  assertGreaterEqual(self, a, b, msg=None)
 |      Just like self.assertTrue(a >= b), but with a nicer default message.
 |  
 |  assertIn(self, member, container, msg=None)
 |      Just like self.assertTrue(a in b), but with a nicer default message.
 |  
 |  assertIs(self, expr1, expr2, msg=None)
 |      Just like self.assertTrue(a is b), but with a nicer default message.
 |  
 |  assertIsInstance(self, obj, cls, msg=None)
 |      Same as self.assertTrue(isinstance(obj, cls)), with a nicer
 |      default message.
 |  
 |  assertIsNone(self, obj, msg=None)
 |      Same as self.assertTrue(obj is None), with a nicer default message.
 |  
 |  assertIsNot(self, expr1, expr2, msg=None)
 |      Just like self.assertTrue(a is not b), but with a nicer default message.
 |  
 |  assertIsNotNone(self, obj, msg=None)
 |      Included for symmetry with assertIsNone.
 |  
 |  assertLess(self, a, b, msg=None)
 |      Just like self.assertTrue(a < b), but with a nicer default message.
 |  
 |  assertLessEqual(self, a, b, msg=None)
 |      Just like self.assertTrue(a <= b), but with a nicer default message.
 |  
 |  assertListEqual(self, list1, list2, msg=None)
 |      A list-specific equality assertion.
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          list1: The first list to compare.
 |          list2: The second list to compare.
 |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
 |                  differences.
 |  
 |  assertLogs(self, logger=None, level=None)
 |      Fail unless a log message of level *level* or higher is emitted
 |      on *logger_name* or its children.  If omitted, *level* defaults to
 |      INFO and *logger* defaults to the root logger.
 |      
 |      This method must be used as a context manager, and will yield
 |      a recording object with two attributes: `output` and `records`.
 |      At the end of the context manager, the `output` attribute will
 |      be a list of the matching formatted log messages and the
 |      `records` attribute will be a list of the corresponding LogRecord
 |      objects.
 |      
 |      Example::
 |      
 |          with self.assertLogs('foo', level='INFO') as cm:
 |              logging.getLogger('foo').info('first message')
 |              logging.getLogger('foo.bar').error('second message')
 |          self.assertEqual(cm.output, ['INFO:foo:first message',
 |                                       'ERROR:foo.bar:second message'])
 |  
 |  assertMultiLineEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
 |      Assert that two multi-line strings are equal.
 |  
 |  assertNotAlmostEqual(self, first, second, places=None, msg=None, delta=None)
 |      Fail if the two objects are equal as determined by their
 |      difference rounded to the given number of decimal places
 |      (default 7) and comparing to zero, or by comparing that the
 |      difference between the two objects is less than the given delta.
 |      
 |      Note that decimal places (from zero) are usually not the same
 |      as significant digits (measured from the most significant digit).
 |      
 |      Objects that are equal automatically fail.
 |  
 |  assertNotAlmostEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
 |  
 |  assertNotEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
 |      Fail if the two objects are equal as determined by the '!='
 |      operator.
 |  
 |  assertNotEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
 |  
 |  assertNotIn(self, member, container, msg=None)
 |      Just like self.assertTrue(a not in b), but with a nicer default message.
 |  
 |  assertNotIsInstance(self, obj, cls, msg=None)
 |      Included for symmetry with assertIsInstance.
 |  
 |  assertNotRegex(self, text, unexpected_regex, msg=None)
 |      Fail the test if the text matches the regular expression.
 |  
 |  assertNotRegexpMatches = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
 |  
 |  assertRaises(self, expected_exception, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Fail unless an exception of class expected_exception is raised
 |      by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
 |      keyword arguments. If a different type of exception is
 |      raised, it will not be caught, and the test case will be
 |      deemed to have suffered an error, exactly as for an
 |      unexpected exception.
 |      
 |      If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
 |      context object used like this::
 |      
 |           with self.assertRaises(SomeException):
 |               do_something()
 |      
 |      An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertRaises
 |      is used as a context object.
 |      
 |      The context manager keeps a reference to the exception as
 |      the 'exception' attribute. This allows you to inspect the
 |      exception after the assertion::
 |      
 |          with self.assertRaises(SomeException) as cm:
 |              do_something()
 |          the_exception = cm.exception
 |          self.assertEqual(the_exception.error_code, 3)
 |  
 |  assertRaisesRegex(self, expected_exception, expected_regex, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Asserts that the message in a raised exception matches a regex.
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          expected_exception: Exception class expected to be raised.
 |          expected_regex: Regex (re pattern object or string) expected
 |                  to be found in error message.
 |          args: Function to be called and extra positional args.
 |          kwargs: Extra kwargs.
 |          msg: Optional message used in case of failure. Can only be used
 |                  when assertRaisesRegex is used as a context manager.
 |  
 |  assertRaisesRegexp = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
 |  
 |  assertRegex(self, text, expected_regex, msg=None)
 |      Fail the test unless the text matches the regular expression.
 |  
 |  assertRegexpMatches = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
 |  
 |  assertSequenceEqual(self, seq1, seq2, msg=None, seq_type=None)
 |      An equality assertion for ordered sequences (like lists and tuples).
 |      
 |      For the purposes of this function, a valid ordered sequence type is one
 |      which can be indexed, has a length, and has an equality operator.
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          seq1: The first sequence to compare.
 |          seq2: The second sequence to compare.
 |          seq_type: The expected datatype of the sequences, or None if no
 |                  datatype should be enforced.
 |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
 |                  differences.
 |  
 |  assertSetEqual(self, set1, set2, msg=None)
 |      A set-specific equality assertion.
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          set1: The first set to compare.
 |          set2: The second set to compare.
 |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
 |                  differences.
 |      
 |      assertSetEqual uses ducktyping to support different types of sets, and
 |      is optimized for sets specifically (parameters must support a
 |      difference method).
 |  
 |  assertTrue(self, expr, msg=None)
 |      Check that the expression is true.
 |  
 |  assertTupleEqual(self, tuple1, tuple2, msg=None)
 |      A tuple-specific equality assertion.
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          tuple1: The first tuple to compare.
 |          tuple2: The second tuple to compare.
 |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
 |                  differences.
 |  
 |  assertWarns(self, expected_warning, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Fail unless a warning of class warnClass is triggered
 |      by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
 |      keyword arguments.  If a different type of warning is
 |      triggered, it will not be handled: depending on the other
 |      warning filtering rules in effect, it might be silenced, printed
 |      out, or raised as an exception.
 |      
 |      If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
 |      context object used like this::
 |      
 |           with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning):
 |               do_something()
 |      
 |      An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertWarns
 |      is used as a context object.
 |      
 |      The context manager keeps a reference to the first matching
 |      warning as the 'warning' attribute; similarly, the 'filename'
 |      and 'lineno' attributes give you information about the line
 |      of Python code from which the warning was triggered.
 |      This allows you to inspect the warning after the assertion::
 |      
 |          with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning) as cm:
 |              do_something()
 |          the_warning = cm.warning
 |          self.assertEqual(the_warning.some_attribute, 147)
 |  
 |  assertWarnsRegex(self, expected_warning, expected_regex, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Asserts that the message in a triggered warning matches a regexp.
 |      Basic functioning is similar to assertWarns() with the addition
 |      that only warnings whose messages also match the regular expression
 |      are considered successful matches.
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          expected_warning: Warning class expected to be triggered.
 |          expected_regex: Regex (re pattern object or string) expected
 |                  to be found in error message.
 |          args: Function to be called and extra positional args.
 |          kwargs: Extra kwargs.
 |          msg: Optional message used in case of failure. Can only be used
 |                  when assertWarnsRegex is used as a context manager.
 |  
 |  assert_ = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
 |  
 |  countTestCases(self)
 |  
 |  debug(self)
 |      Run the test without collecting errors in a TestResult
 |  
 |  defaultTestResult(self)
 |  
 |  doCleanups(self)
 |      Execute all cleanup functions. Normally called for you after
 |      tearDown.
 |  
 |  fail(self, msg=None)
 |      Fail immediately, with the given message.

 |  
 |  setUp(self)
 |      Hook method for setting up the test fixture before exercising it.
 |  
 |  shortDescription(self)
 |      Returns a one-line description of the test, or None if no
 |      description has been provided.
 |      
 |      The default implementation of this method returns the first line of
 |      the specified test method's docstring.
 |  
 |  skipTest(self, reason)
 |      Skip this test.
 |  
 |  subTest(self, msg=<object object at 0x000000000069B270>, **params)
 |      Return a context manager that will return the enclosed block
 |      of code in a subtest identified by the optional message and
 |      keyword parameters.  A failure in the subtest marks the test
 |      case as failed but resumes execution at the end of the enclosed
 |      block, allowing further test code to be executed.

class TestMissingSpeedups(unittest.case.TestCase)
 |  A class whose instances are single test cases.
 |  
 |  By default, the test code itself should be placed in a method named
 |  'runTest'.
 |  
 |  If the fixture may be used for many test cases, create as
 |  many test methods as are needed. When instantiating such a TestCase
 |  subclass, specify in the constructor arguments the name of the test method
 |  that the instance is to execute.
 |  
 |  Test authors should subclass TestCase for their own tests. Construction
 |  and deconstruction of the test's environment ('fixture') can be
 |  implemented by overriding the 'setUp' and 'tearDown' methods respectively.
 |  
 |  If it is necessary to override the __init__ method, the base class
 |  __init__ method must always be called. It is important that subclasses
 |  should not change the signature of their __init__ method, since instances
 |  of the classes are instantiated automatically by parts of the framework
 |  in order to be run.
 |  
 |  When subclassing TestCase, you can set these attributes:
 |  * failureException: determines which exception will be raised when
 |      the instance's assertion methods fail; test methods raising this
 |      exception will be deemed to have 'failed' rather than 'errored'.
 |  * longMessage: determines whether long messages (including repr of
 |      objects used in assert methods) will be printed on failure in *addition*
 |      to any explicit message passed.
 |  * maxDiff: sets the maximum length of a diff in failure messages
 |      by assert methods using difflib. It is looked up as an instance
 |      attribute so can be configured by individual tests if required.

 |  __call__(self, *args, **kwds)
 |      Call self as a function.
 |  
 |  __eq__(self, other)
 |      Return self==value.
 |  
 |  __hash__(self)
 |      Return hash(self).
 |  
 |  __init__(self, methodName='runTest')
 |      Create an instance of the class that will use the named test
 |      method when executed. Raises a ValueError if the instance does
 |      not have a method with the specified name.
 |  
 |  __repr__(self)
 |      Return repr(self).
 |  
 |  __str__(self)
 |      Return str(self).
 |  
 |  addCleanup(self, function, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Add a function, with arguments, to be called when the test is
 |      completed. Functions added are called on a LIFO basis and are
 |      called after tearDown on test failure or success.
 |      
 |      Cleanup items are called even if setUp fails (unlike tearDown).
 |  
 |  addTypeEqualityFunc(self, typeobj, function)
 |      Add a type specific assertEqual style function to compare a type.
 |      
 |      This method is for use by TestCase subclasses that need to register
 |      their own type equality functions to provide nicer error messages.
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          typeobj: The data type to call this function on when both values
 |                  are of the same type in assertEqual().
 |          function: The callable taking two arguments and an optional
 |                  msg= argument that raises self.failureException with a
 |                  useful error message when the two arguments are not equal.
 |  
 |  assertAlmostEqual(self, first, second, places=None, msg=None, delta=None)
 |      Fail if the two objects are unequal as determined by their
 |      difference rounded to the given number of decimal places
 |      (default 7) and comparing to zero, or by comparing that the
 |      difference between the two objects is more than the given
 |      delta.
 |      
 |      Note that decimal places (from zero) are usually not the same
 |      as significant digits (measured from the most significant digit).
 |      
 |      If the two objects compare equal then they will automatically
 |      compare almost equal.
 |  
 |  assertAlmostEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
 |  
 |  assertCountEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
 |      An unordered sequence comparison asserting that the same elements,
 |      regardless of order.  If the same element occurs more than once,
 |      it verifies that the elements occur the same number of times.
 |      
 |          self.assertEqual(Counter(list(first)),

 |  assertDictContainsSubset(self, subset, dictionary, msg=None)
 |      Checks whether dictionary is a superset of subset.
 |  
 |  assertDictEqual(self, d1, d2, msg=None)
 |  
 |  assertEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
 |      Fail if the two objects are unequal as determined by the '=='
 |      operator.
 |  
 |  assertEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
 |  
 |  assertFalse(self, expr, msg=None)
 |      Check that the expression is false.
 |  
 |  assertGreater(self, a, b, msg=None)
 |      Just like self.assertTrue(a > b), but with a nicer default message.
 |

 |  
 |  assertIn(self, member, container, msg=None)
 |      Just like self.assertTrue(a in b), but with a nicer default message.
 |  
 |  assertIs(self, expr1, expr2, msg=None)
 |      Just like self.assertTrue(a is b), but with a nicer default message.
 |  
 |  assertIsInstance(self, obj, cls, msg=None)
 |      Same as self.assertTrue(isinstance(obj, cls)), with a nicer
 |      default message.
 |  
 |  assertIsNone(self, obj, msg=None)
 |      Same as self.assertTrue(obj is None), with a nicer default message.
 |  
 |  assertIsNot(self, expr1, expr2, msg=None)
 |      Just like self.assertTrue(a is not b), but with a nicer default message.
 |  
 |  assertIsNotNone(self, obj, msg=None)
 |      Included for symmetry with assertIsNone.
 |  
 |  assertLess(self, a, b, msg=None)
 |      Just like self.assertTrue(a < b), but with a nicer default message.
 |  
 |  assertLessEqual(self, a, b, msg=None)
 |      Just like self.assertTrue(a <= b), but with a nicer default message.
 |  
 |  assertListEqual(self, list1, list2, msg=None)
 |      A list-specific equality assertion.
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          list1: The first list to compare.
 |          list2: The second list to compare.
 |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
 |                  differences.
 |  
 |  assertLogs(self, logger=None, level=None)
 |      Fail unless a log message of level *level* or higher is emitted
 |      on *logger_name* or its children.  If omitted, *level* defaults to
 |      INFO and *logger* defaults to the root logger.
 |      
 |      This method must be used as a context manager, and will yield
 |      a recording object with two attributes: `output` and `records`.
 |      At the end of the context manager, the `output` attribute will
 |      be a list of the matching formatted log messages and the
 |      `records` attribute will be a list of the corresponding LogRecord
 |      objects.
 |      
 |      Example::
 |      
 |          with self.assertLogs('foo', level='INFO') as cm:
 |              logging.getLogger('foo').info('first message')
 |              logging.getLogger('foo.bar').error('second message')
 |          self.assertEqual(cm.output, ['INFO:foo:first message',
 |                                       'ERROR:foo.bar:second message'])
 |  
 |  assertMultiLineEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
 |      Assert that two multi-line strings are equal.
 |  
 |  assertNotAlmostEqual(self, first, second, places=None, msg=None, delta=None)
 |      Fail if the two objects are equal as determined by their
 |      difference rounded to the given number of decimal places
 |      (default 7) and comparing to zero, or by comparing that the
 |      difference between the two objects is less than the given delta.
 |      
 |      Note that decimal places (from zero) are usually not the same
 |      as significant digits (measured from the most significant digit).
 |      
 |      Objects that are equal automatically fail.
 |  
 |  assertNotAlmostEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
 |  
 |  assertNotEqual(self, first, second, msg=None)
 |      Fail if the two objects are equal as determined by the '!='
 |      operator.
 |  
 |  assertNotEquals = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
 |  
 |  assertNotIn(self, member, container, msg=None)
 |      Just like self.assertTrue(a not in b), but with a nicer default message.
 |  
 |  assertNotIsInstance(self, obj, cls, msg=None)
 |      Included for symmetry with assertIsInstance.
 |  
 |  assertNotRegex(self, text, unexpected_regex, msg=None)
 |      Fail the test if the text matches the regular expression.
 |  
 |  assertNotRegexpMatches = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
 |  
 |  assertRaises(self, expected_exception, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Fail unless an exception of class expected_exception is raised
 |      by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
 |      keyword arguments. If a different type of exception is
 |      raised, it will not be caught, and the test case will be
 |      deemed to have suffered an error, exactly as for an
 |      unexpected exception.
 |      
 |      If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
 |      context object used like this::
 |      
 |           with self.assertRaises(SomeException):
 |               do_something()
 |      
 |      An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertRaises
 |      is used as a context object.
 |      
 |      The context manager keeps a reference to the exception as
 |      the 'exception' attribute. This allows you to inspect the
 |      exception after the assertion::
 |      
 |          with self.assertRaises(SomeException) as cm:
 |              do_something()
 |          the_exception = cm.exception
 |          self.assertEqual(the_exception.error_code, 3)
 |  
 |  assertRaisesRegex(self, expected_exception, expected_regex, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Asserts that the message in a raised exception matches a regex.
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          expected_exception: Exception class expected to be raised.
 |          expected_regex: Regex (re pattern object or string) expected
 |                  to be found in error message.
 |          args: Function to be called and extra positional args.
 |          kwargs: Extra kwargs.
 |          msg: Optional message used in case of failure. Can only be used
 |                  when assertRaisesRegex is used as a context manager.
 |  
 |  assertRaisesRegexp = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
 |  
 |  assertRegex(self, text, expected_regex, msg=None)
 |      Fail the test unless the text matches the regular expression.
 |  
 |  assertRegexpMatches = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)
 |  
 |  assertSequenceEqual(self, seq1, seq2, msg=None, seq_type=None)
 |      An equality assertion for ordered sequences (like lists and tuples).
 |      
 |      For the purposes of this function, a valid ordered sequence type is one
 |      which can be indexed, has a length, and has an equality operator.
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          seq1: The first sequence to compare.
 |          seq2: The second sequence to compare.
 |          seq_type: The expected datatype of the sequences, or None if no
 |                  datatype should be enforced.
 |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
 |                  differences.
 |  
 |  assertSetEqual(self, set1, set2, msg=None)
 |      A set-specific equality assertion.
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          set1: The first set to compare.
 |          set2: The second set to compare.
 |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
 |                  differences.
 |      
 |      assertSetEqual uses ducktyping to support different types of sets, and
 |      is optimized for sets specifically (parameters must support a
 |      difference method).
 |  
 |  assertTrue(self, expr, msg=None)
 |      Check that the expression is true.
 |  
 |  assertTupleEqual(self, tuple1, tuple2, msg=None)
 |      A tuple-specific equality assertion.
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          tuple1: The first tuple to compare.
 |          tuple2: The second tuple to compare.
 |          msg: Optional message to use on failure instead of a list of
 |                  differences.
 |  
 |  assertWarns(self, expected_warning, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Fail unless a warning of class warnClass is triggered
 |      by the callable when invoked with specified positional and
 |      keyword arguments.  If a different type of warning is
 |      triggered, it will not be handled: depending on the other
 |      warning filtering rules in effect, it might be silenced, printed
 |      out, or raised as an exception.
 |      
 |      If called with the callable and arguments omitted, will return a
 |      context object used like this::
 |      
 |           with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning):
 |               do_something()
 |      
 |      An optional keyword argument 'msg' can be provided when assertWarns
 |      is used as a context object.
 |      
 |      The context manager keeps a reference to the first matching
 |      warning as the 'warning' attribute; similarly, the 'filename'
 |      and 'lineno' attributes give you information about the line
 |      of Python code from which the warning was triggered.
 |      This allows you to inspect the warning after the assertion::
 |      
 |          with self.assertWarns(SomeWarning) as cm:
 |              do_something()
 |          the_warning = cm.warning
 |          self.assertEqual(the_warning.some_attribute, 147)
 |  
 |  assertWarnsRegex(self, expected_warning, expected_regex, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Asserts that the message in a triggered warning matches a regexp.
 |      Basic functioning is similar to assertWarns() with the addition
 |      that only warnings whose messages also match the regular expression
 |      are considered successful matches.
 |      
 |      Args:
 |          expected_warning: Warning class expected to be triggered.
 |          expected_regex: Regex (re pattern object or string) expected
 |                  to be found in error message.
 |          args: Function to be called and extra positional args.
 |          kwargs: Extra kwargs.
 |          msg: Optional message used in case of failure. Can only be used
 |                  when assertWarnsRegex is used as a context manager.
 |  
 |  assert_ = deprecated_func(*args, **kwargs)

 |  doCleanups(self)
 |      Execute all cleanup functions. Normally called for you after

 |      
 |      The default implementation of this method returns the first line of
 |      the specified test method's docstring.
 |  
 |  skipTest(self, reason)
 |      Skip this test.
 |  
 |  subTest(self, msg=<object object at 0x000000000069B270>, **params)
 |      Return a context manager that will return the enclosed block
 |      of code in a subtest identified by the optional message and
 |      keyword parameters.  A failure in the subtest marks the test
 |      case as failed but resumes execution at the end of the enclosed
 |      block, allowing further test code to be executed.
